#-----Assignment Description-----------------------------------------#
#
#  Classified Ads
#
#  In this assignment you will combine your knowledge of HTMl/CSS
#  mark-up languages with your skills in Python scripting, pattern
#  matching, databases and Graphical User Interface design to produce
#  a robust, interactive application that allows its user to view
#  and save items currently for sale from multiple online sources.
#
#  See the client's requirements accompanying this file for full
#  details.

#-----Initialisation Steps-------------------------------------------#
#

# Import standard Python 3 modules needed to complete this assignment.
# You should not need to use any modules other than those provided
# in a standard Python 3 installation for your solution.
#
# In particular, you may NOT use any Python modules that need to be
# downloaded and installed separately, such as "Beautiful Soup" or
# "Pillow", because the markers will not have access to such modules
# and will not be able to run your code.  Only modules that are part
# of a standard Python 3 installation may be used.

# A function for exiting the program immediately (renamed
# because "exit" is already a standard Python function).
from sys import exit as abort

# A function for opening a web document given its URL.
# (You WILL need to use this function in your solution,
# either directly or via the "download" function below.)
from urllib.request import urlopen

# Some standard Tkinter functions.  (You WILL need to use
# SOME of these functions in your solution.)  You may also
# import other widgets from the "tkinter" module, provided they
# are standard ones and don't need to be downloaded and installed
# separately.  (NB: Although you can import individual widgets
# from the "tkinter.tkk" module, DON'T import ALL of them
# using a "*" wildcard because the "tkinter.tkk" module
# includes alternative versions of standard widgets
# like "Label".)
from tkinter import *
from tkinter.scrolledtext import ScrolledText
from tkinter.ttk import Progressbar

# Functions for finding occurrences of a pattern defined
# via a regular expression.  (You do not necessarily need to
# use these functions in your solution, because the problem
# can be solved with the string "find" function, but it will
# be difficult to produce a concise and robust solution
# without using regular expressions.)
from re import *

# A function for displaying a web document in the host
# operating system's default web browser (renamed to
# distinguish it from the built-in "open" function for
# opening local files).  (You WILL need to use this function
# in your solution.)
from webbrowser import open as urldisplay

# All the standard SQLite functions.
from sqlite3 import *

# Confirm that the student has declared their authorship.
# You must NOT change any of the code below.
if not isinstance(student_number, int):
    print('\nUnable to run: No student number supplied',
          '(must be an integer)\n')
    abort()
if not isinstance(student_name, str):
    print('\nUnable to run: No student name supplied',
          '(must be a character string)\n')
    abort()

#

#-----Supplied Function----------------------------------------------#
#
# Below is a function you can use in your solution if you find it
# helpful.  (You are not required to use this function, but it may
# save you some effort.)
#

# A function to download and save a web document.  The function
# returns the downloaded document as a character string and
# optionally saves it as a local file.  If the attempted download
# fails, an error message is written to the shell window and the
# special value None is returned.
#
# Parameters:
# * url - The address of the web page you want to download.
# * target_filename - Name of the file to be saved (if any).
# * filename_extension - Extension for the target file, usually
#      "html" for an HTML document or "xhtml" for an XML
#      document.
# * save_file - A file is saved only if this is True. WARNING:
#      The function will silently overwrite the target file
#      if it already exists!
# * char_set - The character set used by the web page, which is
#      usually Unicode UTF-8, although some web pages use other
#      character sets.
# * incognito - If this parameter is True the Python program will
#      try to hide its identity from the web server. This can
#      sometimes be used to prevent the server from blocking access
#      to Python programs. However we discourage using this
#      option as it is both unreliable and unethical to
#      override the wishes of the web document provider!
#
